# Express.js Serving Static files

Allow the users to access static files like CSS or images.

## Exercises:

1. Use CSS in CSS files to change the color of the title.
2. Add image from local folder to the User list page.

### Challenges:

1. Why do we need to manually specify the folders to serve? Why aren't they served by default?
2. Try serving the static file under the files with path prefix "static"
   - Ex. "http://localhost:8000/static/images/cat.jpeg"
